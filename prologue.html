            <p class="h4">Written by Abidano</p>

            <!------------------------STORY----------------------->
            <p>White, it all was. Snowflakes rapidly fell in unison as if they were already aware of their fate, diving with determination to reach it. A long path stretched into the unknown with pine trees as its walls, their leaves rustling chaotically in harmony, a choir of enigma. Amidst the smokey clouds, a silver crescent cut through brightly. It silently watched over all that was within its frozen domain.</p>

            <p>A shadowy figure began to take shape, yet its shadows were light. It radiated a calm melody. A sky-blue cloak wrapped it, its hood concealing its face. It was so long its fabric flowed into the ground like a fountain.</p>

            <p>Slowly, it offered its hand.</p>

            <p>He took it.</p>

            <p>A few seconds pass, as if it was making sure he meant it, but eventually it began to walk him down the path. After 2 or 3 minutes, it stopped and turned to face the right. To his surprise, there was a door. It stood to the left of door, signalling his turn. Cautiously, he grabbed the handle and, after a brief pause, swung the door open. Nothing was there, it was all white. No walls, no ceiling, nothing. There had to be something more to this, he thought. Why else would it have lead him here? Succumbing to his curiousity, he made his way inside. Yet, nothing was there. He simply stood in a vast emptiness. Seeing as there was nothing to achieve, he turned back around to the door to take his leave. Yet there was no door, there never was. Not even <i>it</i> was there. </p>
