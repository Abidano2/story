            <p>White, it all was. Snowflakes rapidly fell in unison as if they were already aware of their fate, diving with determination to reach it. A long path stretched into the unknown with pine trees as its walls, their leaves rustling chaotically in harmony, a choir of enigma. Amidst the smokey clouds, a silver crescent cut through brightly. It silently watched over all that was within its frozen domain.</p>

            <p>A shadowy figure began to take shape, yet its shadows were light. It radiated a calm melody. A sky-blue cloak wrapped it, its hood concealing its face. It was so long its fabric flowed into the ground like a fountain.</p>

            <p>Slowly, it offered its hand.</p>

            <p>He took it.</p>

            <p>A few seconds passed, as if it was making sure he meant it, but eventually it began to walk him down the path. After 2 or 3 minutes, it stopped and turned to face the right. To his surprise, there was a door. It stood to the left of the door, signalling his turn. Cautiously, he grabbed the handle and, after a brief pause, swung the door open. Nothing was there, it was all white. No walls, no ceiling, nothing. There had to be something more to this, he thought. Why else would it have led him here? Succumbing to his curiosity, he made his way inside. Yet, nothing was there. He simply stood in a vast emptiness. Seeing as there was nothing to achieve, he turned back around to the door to take his leave. Yet there was no door, there never was. Not even <i>it</i> was there.</p>

            <p>He stared blindly into the void, he let out a silent scream into the void. One pathetic attempt after another, all in the hope for some kind of answer, but how can you hope for something that didn't even exist? As his grip on reality broke down and faded away, a faint cry began from a distance, was he not alone? Mustering the last of his being, he shuffled towards the sound. It got louder and louder, rattling his core with every weep. Soon, he began to make out a figure in the distance, but as he got closer he came to a shocking realisation: it was him? No, they were much younger. They continued to sob, but never bothered to wipe their tears. Their arms simply hung beside them, they were powerless. He watched from a distance as not to interfere, but couldn't help but notice a strange object beside the child's feet. It was large, sort of looked like fabric? As he continued to analyse it, something chiling became apparent: that was a body, two of them. They lied coldly against the blank surface, their clothes tattered and patterned with damp dots from the child's tears. He jumped back as his shock took the better of him and, as if on cue, a crimson puddle began to grow underneath the bodies. It spread rapidly like a contagious disease. Soon enough, the child too was infected. Their tears turned a scarlet red and their mouth dispensed a sanguine cascade. It continued to spread at a violent rate, spoiling what was once a pure space with an ever-growing rot.</p>

            <p>There was nowhere to go. There was nowhere to move. There was nowhere to breathe. He stood in despair as the blood consumed him, it would be selfish to oppose your own fate after all. He peeked at something he shouldn't have and this was his consequence, his justice, his blessing to not see anything but darkness.</p>

                    <p class="storyblock-text">After months of figuring things out, the prologue for KURONEKO is out! A story with a variety of characters, each with their own unique talent that bridges dreams and reality. Hm? Roses? Sorry, I didn't mean to. The prologue itself didn't take much figuring out for the first part since it is based on an actual dream so it was mainly about figuring out the latter and tying the knot with everything else, and although it is pretty short, I think it works best on its own. It was particularly annoying trying to figure out the ending, but I'm most happy with this outcome compared to the others. I've also decided I'm going to start off with a monthly release for new chapters, so look out for next month's chapter where our protagonist faces off against the nation's most infamous gambler, where he discovers an ace up his sleeve! Anyways, thanks for reading and don't forget, it'd be selfish to oppose your own fate.</p>
