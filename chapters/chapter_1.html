            <p class="h3">Chapter 1 - Poker Face</p>
            <p class="h4">Written by Abidano</p>

            <!------------------------STORY----------------------->

            <p>Darkness, where all things reach their end. For some, the greatest fear, for others, a quiet peace. Although, in this case, this one seemed to have a noisy beeping sound? The hour just struck 3 AM, a signal to show that despite everything, he survived to live another day of his dull existence. His name was Yuki. A teen of 16 with a slim build of average height. The brown bangs of his untamed, mildly wavy, hair framed his face, accompanied by his amber eyes that glimmered in the moonlight that emitted through his window. Beneath that window lied his noire cat, basking in the cold lunar light. Every morning was the same, it began with a brushing of the teeth, followed by a cold shower. It’d be a luxury to have anything warmer after all. Food was left for the cat and, since Yuki was a light eater, a small snack to get him until at least noon. He lived in a small apartment on the second floor of the building. It consisted of one room and a bathroom accompanying it. Decorated by a poorly-aged mattress in the corner and a broken mini-fridge, it was mostly empty, save for the dust that patterned the floor. Yuki wore a turtleneck beige jumper which he then enveloped with his black, cotton aviator jacket, the collar of which consisted of a snow-white fur, and dug his feet into his mud-coated walking boots. Finally, he put on a silver necklace that carried a crescent, he cannot leave without it. After all was done, it was time to head downstairs.</p>
            <p>Careful with every step, he discreetly descended the creaky stairs and made his way into the cardroom. The warm brass-coloured light irradiated him as he passed the different tables surrounded by people. A man walked up to him from behind and nudged his shoulder.</p>
            <p>“Up early aren't ya?”</p>
            <p>It was his landlord. Presented in a Hawaiian shirt that emphasised his belly, cargo jeans covered in faint stains of paint and classic pink flip-flops. His balding head glistened despite being covered by a few long strands of hair. Yuki gave him a disinterested glance and looked back away, unbothered to deal with his wit, as he called it, at such an early hour.</p>
            <p>“I'm just joshing ya, you should lighten up though, the lads are expecting another good show tonight.” He said as he patted Yuki on the back.</p>
            <p>“I’ll wait outside.” replied Yuki, shutting any possibility of a chat down.</p>
            <p>“Already? Well, suit yourself.”</p>
            <p>His landlord had already gotten used to his cold demeanour. The kid in general was an enigma to him. Nothing was known to him about his past, his parents or why he’s the way he is. One thing was for certain though: something serious has happened to him. But at the end of the day, it was nothing his bubbly landlord could ever dream to untangle, so it didn’t bother him much. They both had a deal, and so long as both sides upheld it, nothing was of concern. This short exchange seemed to catch the interest of a nearby bystander who proceeded to turn around on his seat and lean forward.</p>
            <p>“Wassup with him?” he asked.</p>
            <p>“Dunno, kid just rocked up one day all muddy and gritty. He quickly became an attraction though with his talent, never lost once!” replied the landlord in an almost proud tone.</p>
            <p>“Seriously? A kid his age?” the other questioned in disbelief.</p>
            <p>“He's a prodigy I tell ya! I even gave him the upstairs room to stay in since he had nowhere else to go…”</p>
            <p>“… as long as he keeps doing what he does of course.” he continued.</p>
            <p>“Damn what a catch.”</p>
            <p>“Keeps the money flowing!” remarked the landlord.</p>
            <p>It was true. Since the day Yuki set foot in the building, his landlord’s underground gambling business gained many new members who wanted to catch a glimpse of the much-rumoured young prodigy. Not even Yuki knew how, but he always had a certain ‘instinct’ with these types of games, and this ‘instinct’ always guided how he played every move. Additionally, he had an indecipherable face that paired quite nicely with his card talent, making him an unconquerable monolith that crushed every man who dared to stand before it.</p>
            <br />
            <p>The buzzing street lamps illuminated the exterior with a light-grey tint.  Yuki leaned back against the brick wall of the building, standing left of the single-door entrance which another man occupied the right of. The man’s beanie slouched down on his head, concealing his eyes with shade before he lit his cigarette with his lighter. As he took a puff, he noticed Yuki gloomily lurking in his peripheral view.</p>
            <p>“Heh, no worthy opponents?” joked the man in an attempt to spark a conversation.</p>
            <p>Much to his disappointment, however, he was met with Yuki’s usual glance and disregard.</p>
            <p>“The least you could do is introduce yourself.” he followed as he took another puff of his cigarette.</p>
            <p>“I'm Yuki.”</p>
            <p>“Yuki? The kid that waltzed in one day and took the life out of every man's wallet? Yeah I remember you.”</p>
            <p>“Except, you never actually did any of that.”</p>
            <p>“It's boggled my mind since, but you never actually accepted any of the winnings. You always just took a tenner or something to get you through the day.” the man elaborated.</p>
            <p>“I don't need the rest.” said Yuki.</p>
            <p>“Don't need it?! When you walked in that day you looked like you came out of a battlefield and you're telling me you didn't need it?” the man exclaimed.</p>
            <p>“I got food and drink.” replied Yuki.</p>
            <p>“Well, yeah those go without saying, but you gotta treat yourself man. Hell, I’ll give you this pack if you want.” said the man as he reached into his hoodie’s pocket and brought out his cigarette pack, offering it to Yuki.</p>
            <p>Yuki simply ignored him, signalling his refusal.</p>
            <p>“There’s no point anyways.” said Yuki.</p>
            <p>Before the man could reply, a blacked out vehicle parked in front of them, interrupting their conversation, if you can even call it that. The driver, dressed in formal attire, exited the car and proceeded to open the back passenger door. A young man began to come out. He had curtain-styled curly hair, the right half of which was black and the other half white, which matched his earrings that carried a dice each. His eyes were emerald-green, and were surrounded by long, jet-black eyelashes. They contrasted his scarlet tie which rested in between his white long-sleeve shirt and black waist-coat that presented him along with his matching trousers. Elegantly, he stepped out and approached Yuki who didn’t seem to give a second thought to his arrival, which couldn’t be said about the man next to him.</p>
            <p>“H-holy shit..” he mumbled.</p>
            <p>“Hm?” Yuki didn’t quite hear him.</p>
            <p>“I-I gotta tell them about this!”</p>
            <p>The man rushes inside with no explanation, leaving Yuki with the strange man that now stood before him.</p>
            <p>“Ah, you’re a bit young to be at a place like this aren’t you?” wondered the man.</p>
            <p>A smirk appears on his pale face.</p>
            <p>“Yuki, I presume?” he inquired.</p>
            <p>His landlord along with the people inside come out and form an audience. They were all on edge.</p>
            <p>“Hehehe, I must apologise, it’s rude of me not to introduce myself.” said the man before bowing down.</p>
            <p>“The name’s Jack. Jack Ford.”</p>
            <p>As he continued to bow down, he looked up at Yuki with a grin.</p>
            <p>“I assume that’s enough on its own.”</p>
            <p>The crowd began to murmur, there hasn’t been this much suspense since Yuki’s own arrival. His landlord leaned forward next to him and explained:</p>
            <p>“He’s known across the country, the gambling master of the underground. He is said to have gutted one of his opponents once for not being able to pay his bet.”</p>
            <p>“Like you, he never lost a game” he told Yuki who began to realise what he truly was up against.</p>
            <p>The wind grew colder as Jack stood back up.</p>
            <p>“Ah, I appreciate the rundown. And yes, it is as they say: I’ve never lost.” he reiterated.</p>
            <p>“So naturally, as soon as I was made aware of you, I had to come and see for myself.”</p>
            <p>“Therefore, I challenge you, Yuki, to a simple game of cards. One where we will see who truly is the unconquerable one!”</p>
            <br />
            <p>Yuki and Jack sat opposite each other at a table with a stack of cards in the centre. Everyone else formed a circle around them from which they spectated. Among that crowd, stood Yuki’s landlord as he wiped his sweating forehead with a napkin. Breaking the silence, Jack began to explain the rules of the game.</p>
            <p>“The game is nothing too fancy, just a simple round of ‘High and Low’. I’ll place the cards face down and draw one, you will then need to guess whether the next card is higher or lower in value.”</p>
            <p>“If you can guess all the cards with no faults, then I will kneel down to you as the true master of the underground.” he continued.</p>
            <p>“However…” he paused, indicating the catch about to follow.</p>
            <p>“…if I am to win, then I’d like a little something in return, something… valuable”</p>
            <p>As if on cue, Yuki’s cat jumped onto his left shoulder. It seems that the commotion has woken it up so it decided to come down and investigate.</p>
            <p>“Ah, that’ll suffice-”</p>
            <p>“No.” Yuki cut him off, his voice echoed across the dirty-yellow room.</p>
            <p>“Oh, it seems that it’s personal to you. Such high stakes couldn’t be more befitting of our stand-off.” Jack’s face lit up at the opportunity.</p>
            <p>“Besides, I’ll let you take whatever you want from me if you win, so you can’t say I’m being unfair.”</p>
            <p>“Although… I have a feeling you wouldn’t take anything either way.” he smirked.</p>
            <p>Yuki was backed into a corner, Jack was right after all, he wouldn’t take a single penny despite Jack offering him anything, making it fair for him to take his cat if he wins. He had no choice but to go through with it, no choice but to trust his gut that led him all this way.</p>
            <p>“Here, I’ll be even nicer and go first.” he volunteered as he pushed the cards towards Yuki.</p>
            <p>“Whenever you’re ready, draw the first card.”</p>
            <p>Finally succumbing to the pressure, Yuki draws the card.</p>
            <p>“Ah, a nine of spades. Chances are slightly higher that the next card will be lower than a nine.” predicted Jack.</p>

            <p>“Low.”</p>
            <p>Yuki drew the card. It was as Jack predicted.</p>
            <p>“Hm, four of hearts. Low.”</p>
            <p>The next card was drawn, it was yet another correct guess.</p>
            <p>“A three of clubs. Low.”</p>
            <p>Another right guess.</p>
            <p>“High. High. Low. High. High. Low. High. Low. High…”</p>
            <p>A card was drawn after another, the pace growing more rapid with every guess. The audience’s tension turned into fear, and the landlord’s face was struck by horror. Yuki, too, was shocked. He hasn’t felt such fear in a long time. What sat before him was no ordinary being. This wasn’t talent, it was something else.</p>
            <p>“…Low. High. High. Low. High. High. Low.”</p>
            <p>The final card was drawn, falling onto the table as a last sign of defeat.</p>
            <p>“Oh, is that it?” asked Jack.</p>
            <p>“Well then, here you go.” he grabbed the stack of cards and reshuffled it, after which he flipped upside down.</p>
            <p>It was Yuki’s turn. He has yet to process what just went down, but he had to try and concentrate, for the sake of his cat. Eagerly, Jack begins to draw the first card.</p>
            <p>“A 6 of diamonds. How lucky! So, what’s your say?” quizzed Jack.</p>
            <p>For the first time, Yuki was unsure. His usual ‘instinct’ was gone, the one thing that brought him this far and even put a roof above his head, it had abandoned him. Witnessing Yuki’s despair, Jack began to giggle.</p>
            <p>“I-I…”</p>
            <p>The giggling gradually turned into a maniacal laughter.</p>
            <p>“I think… low-”</p>
            <p>“WRONG!”</p>

            <p>Jack had drawn the card as Yuki made his guess, revealing it at the moment he finished his gamble. Jack lunged forward at the cat sitting on Yuki’s shoulder. Immediately, Yuki moved his head to cover the cat in reflex. However, something grave quickly became apparent. Jack was holding a blade. Its end bent like a hook. Before either could react, the blade thrust into Yuki’s left eye. Jack violently pulled his knife, gouging Yuki’s eye out in the process. The cat had already long-departed this sight. Yuki jolted back in pain, his hand covering the sorry sight of a now-empty cavity. Jack sat back, holding up his knife and displaying  the gorey, white organ that perched on it. The audience howled in terror, but was frozen in uncertainty of what this man’s next action was.</p>
            <p>“AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!! OH IT’S SO BEAUTIFUL WHAT DESPERATION DOES TO A MAN. ALL SENSE IS LOST, ONLY HIS PRIMAL INSTINCTS REMAIN TO PUPPETEER HIM.” Jack roared.</p>
            <p>“SUCH IS THE BEAUTY OF GAMBLING. A NEVER-ENDING CYCLONE OF NAIVE HOPE AND SOUL-DEMOLISHING DESPAIR.”</p>

            <!-------------------------------------------->
            <p>Everything was hazy. Yuki was barely unsure of what even happened. He lost his eye, that much he was sure of. However, something was strange. Despite it being gone, he could still see? Everything was blue in hue through that eye, but it was clear. He saw ceiling fans turn, the people trembling, and Jack... speaking? It contradicted his remaining eye though, Jack was still in a fit of laughter. However, a few seconds later...</p>
            <p>“YOU TRULY WERE NOTHING AFTER ALL, YOU NEVER WERE.”</p>
            <p>It was exactly as he saw it in his left, blue vision. Same arm gestures, same expression, same mouth movement. Could it be? Was this his ‘instinct’? It all made sense now, this is what has been guiding him. And now, it has blossomed into a new discernible form. With this new tool, he can now try and figure out what went wrong. He began by laying out the foundations: this special ability has always let him know what cards were next without fail. Today, however, it couldn’t. Something changed, something about the cards. Attempting to find that something, he reached for the cards and began scouring through them… and there it was, his answer.</p>
            <p>“Now. I must claim my true pri- what are you doing.” Jack demanded an answer after noticing Yuki’s rummaging.</p>
            <p>“You didn’t win.” Yuki declared.</p>
            <p>“Oh? I’m sorry, is the adrenaline getting into your shitty head?” Jack responded in an offended manner.</p>
            <p>“I get it now, my instinct, your skill. I see it now.” said Yuki.</p>
            <p>“Turns out, we’re both special.”</p>
            <p>“I always had the ability to tell what card is next.” he explained.</p>
            <p>“But with you, it didn’t work.”</p>
            <p>“Yeah no fucking shit you can’t see it.” Jack rebutted.</p>
            <p>“But I can, and… there was nothing. The card’s face was just static-y.” claimed Yuki.</p>
            <p>“And that’s your trick. You can manipulate what card’s next, making it impossible for the other to guess right.”</p>
            <p>“What a fucking schizo analysis. Alright then, if I did change what card is next, how are you gonna prove it?” said Jack, countering him.</p>
            <p>“With this.”</p>
            <p>Yuki holds up two cards, they were two 6 of Diamonds.</p>
            <p>“Cards here are checked before every game. Stuff like this can never slip through.” Yuki explained.</p>
            <p>“So, it leaves no other possibility. You changed the cards with your skill, and made the mistake of creating a duplicate card.” Yuki concluded.</p>

            <p>Jack fury grew. He began to hyperventilate and almost foam at the mouth. Before it could get ugly, he reached into his pocket to grab a can of pills which he then took a pill out of and swallowed. Immediately, he calmed down and collected himself, after which he took his phone out and dialled a number.</p>

            <p>Chaos ensued. The crowd began to panic and flee the cramped room, attempting to all squeeze through the narrow exit. Jack vanished amidst the commotion and the landlord was stuck behind, unable to get through. Yuki simply remained where he sat. These people had many things to lose, they had a right to flee to protect those things, but Yuki had nothing, and how can you lose something you’ve already lost? Soon after, the blaring sirens announced the police’s arrival. Those who couldn’t make it were arrested and taken there and then. An officer grabbed Yuki, who bore a tired and fed-up expression on his face, and made him stand up, handcuffing his hands behind him. Seeing his left eye, the officer grabbed a black ribbon off the floor that had fallen off one of the escapees and used it to bandage it. The officer dragged Yuki outside where the early morning twilight painted the skies. Seeing the two, another officer approached them and began to inquire.</p>
            <p>“You sure that’s him?” He asked with scepticism.</p>
            <p>“Positive. That eye is undeniable.” The officer confirmed.</p>
            <p>“But he’s just a kid! Oh well, I guess we have no choice. Maya!”</p>
            <p>A tall woman in her late thirties strode over. She had spikey, ginger hair tied in a low ponytail and deep amethyst eyes. Unlike the officers, she was dressed in a suit and carried a sword by her side.</p>
            <p>“Uh huh?” She responded.</p>
            <p>“We caught this unregistered ability user, but turns out he’s a kid so we can’t really leave him.” explained the officer.</p>
            <p>“What’s this gotta do with me?” she asked in an impatient tone.</p>
            <p>“From now on, you're his government-assigned guardian.” said the officer.</p>
            <p>“I’M HIS WHAT?! Ughh, what a drag.” she sighed.</p>
            <p>“Fine, what’s your name?” she asked Yuki, but as she turned around to face him… he wasn’t there?</p>
            <p>“HUH? HEY! YOU COME BACK HERE!” yelled the officer.</p>
            <p>Maya turned around and saw Yuki sprinting away. He didn’t accept this, he was not going to live with this complete stranger. Unfortunately, he never had a choice.</p>
            <p>“It’s fine, we’re gonna get used to this.” Maya reassured the officer.</p>
            <p>“Still Shock.”</p>

            <p>Suddenly, Yuki’s body froze still. He was stuck in the position he was running in as if time had stopped.</p>

            <p>“My ability is perfectly suited for this, so don’t bother.” said Maya.</p>
            <p>“Anyway, I’ll find us a place and get him enrolled as soon as possible. I better get paid handsomely though, understood?” Maya demanded the officer.</p>
            <p>“I will speak to the department about it-”</p>
            <p>“UNDERSTOOD?”</p>
            <p>“Y-yes ma’am!”</p>

            <p>Later that day, somewhere in the city, Jack entered through a large double door. The room was quite spacious and dimly lit. Said light shined through the tall stained-glass window at the back of the room. Before that window, sat a man on his knees. His hands were joined together and his eyes closed.</p>
            <p>“I am sorry to interrupt, boss. I’ve come to report my findings.”</p>
            <p>The man concluded his prayers and, while still facing the window, spoke with a European accent.</p>
            <p>“Very well.”</p>
            <p>“Turns out, he was indeed an ability user. He was able to see right through my ability.” Jack explained.</p>
            <p>“He possessed foresight.”</p>
            <p>The man bit a piece of skin off his lower lip, making it bleed slowly.</p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 0">“Εξοχος.” he said as a smile appeared on his face.</p>
            <p class="tr" style="letter-spacing: 0.2em; margin-left: 2.5em">EXCELLENT</p>
            <p>He rose and turned to face Jack.</p>
            <p>“We have finally found it, our final key.”</p>

                    <p class="storyblock-text">Gambling is my passion. This chapter was already planned (except for very minor changes while writing) before the prologue was even released. Its release almost had to be delayed for 2 weeks because I had so much stuff going on but I sat myself down last night and worked on it for 6 hours straight. I started getting tired halfway through so I feel like this chapter came out much weaker than I intended, it delivered the planned story though so I'm fine with it. It's also probably going to be the shortest chapter, besides the prologue of course, but 3k+ words for a first chapter is still a bit. As for next chapter, I already have the title, sypnosis, characters, abilities, and major events planned, but other than that not much, so I can't really give a release date for now as this next month is going to be so packed for me. I want this next chapter to take its time so it doesn't end up as rushed as this one, so the wait might be long, but I hope to make it worth it. I know a certain someone will be excited to meet you then. So, I hope you enjoyed this chapter despite the setbacks, and I'll see you at school! I just hope things don't take a dark turn...</p>
